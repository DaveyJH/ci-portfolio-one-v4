## Objective
In this project I intend to provide a portfolio style website for my sister's wildlife photography.  The main objective is to demonstrate competency in HTML and CSS.  I hope to provide an emotive, static front end application which is easy to navigate and has a clear purpose.
***
## Brief
### **Katie Horrocks - Wildlife Photography**
<!-- link to site here -->
The goal of this website is to promote Katie Horrocks' photography.  The client would like to have:
- a brief introduction, who she is and what she does
- the client intends to display a few small galleries
- a contact form
- links to her social media sites

Katie does not work professionally as a photographer, the site is to serve as a platform for displaying her pictures and allowing interested parties to contact her for general purposes.

*She may, at a later date, add a blog to the site so that element should be considered during the design of the application.*
***
## UX &#8722; User Experience Design
### User Requirements
Some example user stories which will effect the design
 
- *"As a first time visitor, I want to know what this site is about. I may use a number of different devices (mobile/tablet etc.) to view the site. I would like to be able to navigate easily"*
- *"As a returning visitor, I want to take a look at some different galleries and possibly some social media links. I am interested in learning a little more about Katie, but I really do like the photographs"*
- *"As an interested person, I would like to see some of Katie's work. I want to be able to contact Katie, perhaps connect with her via social media"*

### Initial Concept
With photographic images featuring as a really important aspect of the site, I  hope to keep the design fairly free from other distractions. I anticipate using a fairly neutral colour scheme as I feel this will allow the content images to stand out more from the design aspects. The application is to be designed with 'mobile first' in mind.
#### Wireframes

#### Colour Scheme

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
<!-- - Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z -->

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

## Technologies Used

<!-- In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used. -->
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
    - The project uses icons from Font Awesome version 5

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Bugs
1. The anchor elements in the nav section do not span the 'tab' which they sit in. More evident on wider screens, could lead to bad UX
***
## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
